# Network-Security-Using-Deep-Belief-Network
   • Led a comprehensive project focused on enhancing network security through the application of Deep Belief
Networks (DBNs) to detect anomalies and potential threats within a complex network environment. Developed and
implemented a novel model leveraging DBNs to enhance the organization’s cybersecurity posture.
• Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging the power of Deep Belief Networks (DBN). The primary goal of the
project was to enhance the organization’s network security by developing a cutting-edge IDS solution that could
effectively detect and mitigate potential cyber threats.
• Conducted in-depth research on IDS methodologies, evaluated machine learning algorithms, and explored the
benefits of integrating DBN for network traffic analysis and anomaly detection, contributing to enhanced
cybersecurity measures.
• The IDS with DBN demonstrated superior accuracy in identifying previously unknown and complex network
anomalies. The solution’s real-time capabilities allowed for swift response to potential threats, significantly reducing
the risk of security breaches
